In this first step, try to understand the purpose and dependencies of the spec we will be migrating.

1. Read the provided RSpec file carefully to understand:
   - The purpose of the test suite
   - The subject under test (SUT)
   - Test structure and organization
   - Dependencies and fixtures used
   - Mocks, stubs, and doubles

2. Use your tools to search for the SUT implementation and any other important dependent files so that they will be in the context for future steps in this process.
   - Dependencies include fixtures
   - Note that test/fixtures already has quite a bit of fixture files present
   - If any fixtures are missing, copy them over when you write the new test file later
   - Do not check non-text files into the repository, such as images or other binary files

3. Identify RSpec-specific features being used, such as:
   - describe/context blocks
   - before/after hooks
   - let and let! declarations
   - expect(...).to syntax and matchers
   - shared examples/contexts
   - metadata and tags

4. Provide a summary of your analysis, including:
   - Purpose of the test suite
   - Main subject under test
   - Key dependencies
   - Testing patterns used
   - Any potentially challenging aspects for Minitest conversion

This analysis will guide the next steps of creating an equivalent Minitest implementation.
